# Code for “Alita: A Sensible Digital Twin Framework for Perception, Task-Replanning and Control of Robot-Environment Interaction”

It involves our previous works—“Multisource model-driven digital twin system of robotic assembly” (published in IEEE systems journal, Doi: 10.1109/JSYST.2019.2958874) and “Semantic Enhanced Digital Twin System for Robot-Environment Interaction Monitoring” (published in IEEE TIM, Doi:10.1109/TIM.2021.3066542)

The REI_DT file mainly introduces how to build the four-layer digital twin model for robot environment interaction, as well as information transmission strategy between physical space and digital space.

The Task _Re-Planning file contains the structure, training code, etc. of the REI task-re planning model based on the REI-DT, and also provides the re-planning dataset

The Robot_ Control file describes how to control the virtual/real robot arm through position, joint and atomic action commands (ur5 robot arm is used in Alita)
